###### Simple implementations of Steiner Triple System constructions for Math 5770

1. Cyclic Steiner Triples
	* Generates cyclic steiner triple systems using a basic construction
2. Mutually Orthonogal Latin Squares
	* Creates Mutually orthogonal latin squares using the direct product construction
	* Currently only works for order 8 MOLS
3. Wilson Construction 
	* Generates steiner triple systems using Wilson construction
